# What is Phrasey?

Phrasey is a versatile i18n build system designed to streamline the management and compilation of translation files for easier localization.

## What it does?

-   **Translation Management:** Helps you organize and manage translation files within your project. It simplifies the process of handling translations by providing a build system.

-   **Build Process:** Takes care of the build process of translation files. Supports a variety of input and output formats, like JSON, YAML, TOML, XML, or even custom formats.

-   **More than a Tooling:** Exposes its core functionality allowing it to be used as a library to leverage Phrasey's feature and your own requirements allowing custom build solutions.

## What it doesn't do?

-   **Auto-Translation:** Does not include automatic translation capabilities. It does not perform the actual translation of the content within the translation files. Instead, it concentrates on the organization and conversion aspects of the build process, working with the translations provided by developers or professional translators.

-   **Framework Integration:** Although it can generate output files in various formats suitable for different frameworks, it does not directly integrate with any specific framework out-of-the-box. After the build process, you'll need to handle the integration of the translated strings within your chosen framework or library separately.
